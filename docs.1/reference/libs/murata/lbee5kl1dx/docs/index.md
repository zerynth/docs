# Murata LBEE5KL1DX

The Type 1DX module is an ultra-small module that includes 2.4GHz WLAN and Bluetooth functionality.

Based on Cypress CYW4343W, the module provide high-efficiency RF front end circuits. The module is designed to fit into small spaces and is smaller than a dime. Minimal external circuitry is required to complete a radio design; add an antenna, power source, clocks, processor, and associated interface hardware and the radio hardware design is complete.

To ease Wi-Fi certification, the Type 1DX module complies with IEEE 802.11b/g/n and Bluetooth Version 4.1 plus EDR, Power Class 1 (10dBm max) + BLE.

The Murata LBEE5KL1DX single-chip device provides the highest level of integration for mobile and handheld wireless systems, featuring integrated IEEE 802.11 b/g and handheld device class IEEE 802.11n. It includes a 2.4 GHz WLAN CMOS power amplifier (PA) that meets the output power requirements of most handheld systems.

Along with the integrated power amplifier, the LBEE5KL1DX also includes integrated transmit and receive baluns, further reducing the overall solution cost.
