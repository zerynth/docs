# MEAS HTU21D

The HTU21D is a relative humidity sensor with temperature output by MEAS. This sensor provides calibrated, linearized signals in digital, I²C format for interfacing directly with a micro-controller and its low power consumption permits to implement high volume and cost sensitive applications with tight space constraints.

The HTU21D is designed for applications in automotive field (defogging, HVAC, etc), home appliance, medical field, printers, humidifier, and many more.
