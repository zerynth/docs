# DLH Module

The DLH Series Mini Digital Output Sensor is based on All Sensors’ CoBeam2 TM Technology.
This reduces package stress susceptibility, resulting in improved overall long term stability and vastly improves the position sensitivity.
The digital interface options ease integration of the sensors into a wide range of process control and measurement systems, allowing direct connection to serial communications channels.

For battery-powered systems, the sensors can enter very low-power modes between readings to minimize load on the power supply.These calibrated and compensated sensors provide accurate, stable output over a wide temperature range.

This series is intended for use with non-corrosive, non-ionic working fluids such as air, dry gases and the like. A protective parylene coating is optionally available for moisture/harsh media protection.
