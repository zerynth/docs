# Espressif ESP8266 Wifi

Espressif ESP8266 delivers highly integrated Wi-Fi SoC solution for efficient power usage, compact design and reliable performance in the Internet of Things industry.

With the complete and self-contained Wi-Fi networking capabilities, ESP8266EX can perform either as a standalone application or as the slave to a host MCU. The integrated highspeed cache helps to increase the system performance and optimize the system memory.

Also, ESP8266EX can be applied to any micro-controller design as a Wi-Fi adaptor through SPI/SDIO or I2C/UART interfaces.

ESP8266EX integrates antenna switches, RF balun, power amplifier, low noise receive amplifier, filters and power management modules. The compact design minimizes the PCB size and requires minimal external circuitries.

Besides the Wi-Fi functionalities, ESP8266EX also integrates an enhanced version of Tensilica L106 Diamond series 32-bit processor and on-chip SRAM. It can be interfaced with external sensors and other devices through the GPIOs; more information at [Espressif dedicated page](https://espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp8266ex/overview)
