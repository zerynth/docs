# Examples

The following are a list of examples for lib.xinabox.cr02

## Temperature to The Things Network


This examples reads temperature data from SW01 (BME280) and sends it to The Things Network via LoRaWAN.



```main.py```

```python
''' 
LoraWan implementation using CR02, CW02 and SW01
This example sends temperature data to ttn dashboard.

CR02 LED functionality
_______________________

BLUE    : blinks once when keys are received
RED     : flashes once every send cycle (60sec hardcoded in .bin file)
GREEN   : Will remain steady once connection to ttn is established


**************************NOTE!!!!!!!!!!!***************************
A 10 second delay is utilized prior to any communication over
the i2c bus or uart. Do not remove the delay or the CW02 will lock
up when the console is opened.

If the console is needed, open it up within the 10 second interval.
Alternatively, use a terminal that can set DTR and RTS on. We
recommend CoolTerm. Do not open up zerynth console during runtime.
