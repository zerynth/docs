# NXP MPL3115A2

The MPL3115A2 is a compact piezoresistive absolute pressure sensor with an I2C interface.
MPL3115 has a wide operating range of 20kPa to 110 kPa, a range that covers all surface elevations on Earth.

The fully internally compensated MEMS in conjunction with an embedded high resolution 24-bit equivalent ADC provide accurate pressure [Pascals] /altitude [meters] and temperature [degrees Celsius] data. The internal processing in MPL3115A2 removes compensation and unit conversion load from the system MCU, simplifying system design.
