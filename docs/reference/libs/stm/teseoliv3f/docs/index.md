# STM Teseo Liv3F

The Teseo-LIV3F module is an easy to use Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) standalone module, embedding TeseoIII single die standalone positioning receiver IC working simultaneously on multiple constellations (GPS/Galileo/Glonass/BeiDou/QZSS).

Thanks to the embedded 16 Mbit flash Teseo-LIV3F offers many extra features such as data logging, 7 days autonomous assisted GNSS, FW reconfigurability as well as FW upgrades.
Teseo-LIV3F provides also the Autonomous Assisted GNSS able to predict satellite data based on previous observation of satellite.
