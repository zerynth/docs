# Microchip WINC1500

Microchip’s WINC1500 is an IEEE 802.11 b/g/n IoT network controller. It brings Wi-Fi and Network capabilities through SPI-to-Wi-Fi interface. The WINC1500’s most advanced mode is a single stream 1x1 802.11n mode providing up to 72 Mbps PHY throughput.

The WINC1500 features a fully integrated Power Amplifier, LNA, Switch and Power Management. The WINC1500 provides internal Flash memory as well as multiple peripheral interfaces including UART and SPI. The only external clock source needed for the WINC1500 is a high-speed crystal or oscillator (26 MHz). The WINC1500 is available in a QFN package or as a certified module.
The WINC1500 has 4 Mb of flash memory which can be used for system software.
