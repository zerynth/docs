# Broadcom BCM43362

The Broadcom BCM43362 single-chip device provides the highest level of integration for mobile and handheld wireless systems, featuring integrated IEEE 802.11 b/g and handheld device class IEEE 802.11n. It includes a 2.4 GHz WLAN CMOS power amplifier (PA) that meets the output power requirements of most handheld systems.

Along with the integrated power amplifier, the BCM43362 also includes integrated transmit and receive baluns, further reducing the overall solution cost.

Host interface options include SDIO v2.0 that can operate in 4b or 1b modes, and a generic SPI mode; more information on [Broadcom Community](https://community.broadcom.com)
