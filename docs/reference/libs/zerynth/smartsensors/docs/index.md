# Zerynth Smart Sensors

A Smart Sensor, at a minimum, is made of a sensor that takes input from the physical environment and uses built-in compute resources to perform predefined functions upon detection of specific input and then process data before passing it on.

Smart sensors enable more accurate and automated collection of environmental data with less erroneous noise amongst the accurately recorded information. These sensors are used for monitoring and control mechanisms in a wide variety of environments including smart grids, battlefield reconnaissance, exploration and they have become a crucial and integral element in the Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

A smart sensor may also include a number of other components besides the primary sensor. These components can include transducers, amplifiers, excitation control, analog filters and compensation. A smart sensor also incorporates software-defined elements that provide functions such as data conversion, digital processing and communication to external devices.

Zerynth Smart Sensor set of libraries and built-in functions helps to handle and manage all sensors connected to specific pins of a device.

Here below, the Zerynth Libraries for Generic Sensors class with Analog/Digital subclasses and Sensor Pool; there are also some examples to better understand how to use these libraries.
