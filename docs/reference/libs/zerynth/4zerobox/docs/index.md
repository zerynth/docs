# 4ZeroBox Library

4ZeroBox is a modular hardware electronic unit that simplifies the development of Industrial IoT applications allowing rapid integration with sensors, actuators, and Cloud services.

4ZeroBox lets the user choose the best installation strategy, adapting it to the specific industrial environment. While allowing to acquire data from the PLC via digital ports - filtering the data onboard to avoid bandwidth overload and waste of cloud resources - it also enable the installation and management of external sensors, for a full Industrial IoT experience.
