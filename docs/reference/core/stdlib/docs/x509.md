# X509

This module allows to perform useful operations involving [x509 certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509).


### generate_csr_for_key(key, subject)
Generate a Certificate Signing Request from `subject` signed with key `key`.


* **param subject**

    is a string containing a comma-separated list of OID types and values (e.g. `"C=IT,O=ZER,CN=device 1"`)



* **param key**

    can be: a null terminated string (must end with a 0 byte) containing a valid key or an empty string to use a hardware one.


To enable the use of hardware keys a hardware cryptographic interface must be started.

For example, with an `ATECC508A` (ATECCx08A interface):

```
import x509
from microchip.ateccx08a import ateccx08a

# ...

ateccx08a.hwcrypto_init(I2C0, 0) # select private key stored in slot 0
x509.generate_csr_for_key('', subject)
```

(in this case `ZERYNTH_HWCRYPTO_ATECCx08A` must be also set to true in `project.yml`)

```NOTE```: generating a CSR requires a big stack, probably not available inside the main thread. It is suggested to call this function from a separate thread with a custom stack size (e.g. `thread(generate_function, size=12288)`) .
